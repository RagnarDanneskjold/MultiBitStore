  <h2>The Short Version</h2>

  <p>It is possible for you to make a purchase from us and <em>reveal no information about yourself whatsoever</em>.</p>

  <p>Once a purchase has been completed, we will provide you with a digitally signed receipt that can be verified
    independently from a public key repository. This receipt contains no personally identifying information and
    will be held on our systems and our backups. It can be used to act as a proof of purchase should any problems
    arise.</p>

  <p><strong>If you lose the receipt, and have not provided any additional information to us, then we will not be
    able to
    verify your purchase.</strong>

      <h3>Cookies</h3>

      <p>We will place a session cookie onto your machine to allow us to anonymously authenticate you during your
        session with us.
        Once you close the browser the information in that cookie is lost forever.</p>

      <p>If you open an account with us, we will place a permanent cookie onto your machine to allow us to
        authenticate you during further sessions with us.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span3">
      <h3>Digital Products</h3>

      <p>Your signed receipt will contain a unique token to permit download of your item(s). This token is only to
        authorise the download of your purchase and contains no other personally identifying information.
      </p>

      <p>We will retain the token on our systems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="span3">
      <h3>Physical Products</h3>

      <p>In order to deliver your item we will need the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>contact information (so that we can get in touch if there are problems)</li>
        <li>delivery address (for the courier)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will retain this information on our systems.</p>

<h2>Full Version</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span12">

    <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website, as
      well as our members. This Privacy Policy will explain what information we
      collect through our websites and how it is used.</p>

    <p>In this policy, "we", "us" and "our" refers to company staff, board members, cooperating lawyers, interns,
      volunteers, and consultants, all of whom are bound by law or contract to keep confidential information they
      receive as part of their assistance to our organisation.</p>

    <p>We do not sell or rent member or website visitor information under any circumstances, and we do not
      share member or visitor information without prior consent except as compelled by law. (See discussion
      below).</p>

    <h3>Information Gathered By Our Site</h3>

    <h4>Logging</h4>

    <p>For visitors to our website, we generally log requests to our website through a program called
      logback (described further below) and do internal analytical logging (also described further
      below) for up to seven days from when the data was collected.</p>

    <p>Circumstances in which we may need to log and retain technical information for longer than seven days include
      when we believe it is reasonably necessary to continue our operations, including situations such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>diagnosis of technical problems</li>
      <li>defending against attacks to the site,</li>
      <li>handling a spike in traffic or other abnormal, short-term circumstances</li>
      <li>site testing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In those and similar situations we will delete the information as soon as it is apparent that the information
      is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was retained.</p>

    <h4>How We Use Logback</h4>

    <p>Every logging message takes the IP address portion of the request getting logged and encrypts it, as
      well as a chunk of random data (the salt), using a cryptographic hash function. The salt changes every night,
      which should result in making it very difficult for us, or anyone else, to recover IP addresses from our logs.</p>

    <h4>Cookies</h4>

    <p>We use persistent ID cookies on this site only for authentication purposes. We use session cookies on
      certain portions of the website. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. You can use Tor if you wish
      to keep your connection information anonymous.</p>

    <h4>Voluntarily Submitted Information</h4>

    <p>In addition, we collect and retain information you voluntarily submit to
      us. It is up to you whether to submit information to us, and how much information to provide. If you choose to
      become a member we ask for:
    <ul>
      <li>your name (so that we may informally address you in communications)</li>
      <li>an email address (so that we may contact you efficiently)</li>
      <li>a mailing address (to allow us a secure offline communication channel)</li>
      <li>a phone number (so that we may contact you urgently)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your purchases with us are limited to digital products we are able to operate without any of the above
      information so you may remain completely anonymous. Clearly, with physical products, other than direct
      collections,
      we will require at least a delivery address to provide you with your purchase.</p>

    <p>We may ask for additional personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or otherwise communicate
      with us.</p>

    <p>From time to time, we may ask for personal information on other portions of the site, such as asking you to
      participate in an online contest, vote or review.</p>

    <h4>Mailing Lists</h4>

    <p>If you choose to subscribe to our newsletter or any of our other mailing lists, we will need to collect your
      email address,
      and a mailing address if you wish to receive a brochure or similar.</p>

    <h3>Our Use Of Information</h3>

    <p>In general, we use the information provided by you to deliver your purchases and suggest recommendations
      for additional products that may be of interest based on your purchase history.</p>

    <h4>Member Information</h4>

    <p>We use member information to process and manage your account. If you opt in, we will use your email address
      to send you updates and alerts regarding new and relevant products that we believe may be of genuine
      interest to you.</p>

    <h4>Invitees</h4>

    <p>If you invite another person to create an account we will ask for
      that person's name and online contact information. We use this information to contact and, if necessary,
      remind that person that he or she has been invited to sign up with us.</p>

    <h4>Publication By Us</h4>

    <p>If you provide information for publication (such as a product review) we may use your name and contact
      information
      you have provided to us to provide you with attribution. You can select which information can be used.</p>

    <h4>Other Activities</h4>

    <p>We may run surveys, contests, or similar activities through this site. Such information will
      be used for the purposes for which it was collected. We also look at technical information to diagnose
      problems with or consider improvements to our servers or related technologies and to administer the other
      websites we host or provide.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Service Providers</h3>

    <p>Portions of our website, including our email and content delivery networks are operated by third-party
      companies. These service providers may place session cookies on your
      computer. They may also log standard technical information, such as the numerical Internet
      Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system;
      the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly
      to our site. Our service providers may also store and organise the personal information collected through this
      site on our behalf.</p>

    <p><strong>We do not use external payment processors for your purchases</strong>. Therefore all the information collected from
      our members and visitors purchases remains under our control, and we ensure that the information is kept
      confidential
      and disclosed only to employees who require such access in the course of their assigned duties. We also require
      all of our third-party service providers to notify us if they receive legal process seeking information about
      visitors to our website.</p>

    <p>We may change the specific third-party providers from time to time, and will transfer stored information to
      any new provider subject to similar restrictions and agreements. From time to time, we may work with
      third-party consultants or other service providers who may have access to personally identifiable information.
      In such cases, we will restrict their use of personally identifiable information in accordance with their
      assigned tasks.</p>

    <p>Our site also provides links to a wide variety of third-party websites, including interactive links to sites
      like YouTube, Twitter or mapping services. We are not responsible for, and do not have any control over, the
      privacy
      practices or the content of such third parties. We encourage our members and visitors to read the privacy policies
      of any website visited via links from our website.</p>

    <p>We do occasionally allow our website to interact with other services, like social networking, mapping, and
      video hosting websites. It is our policy not to include third-party resources when users initially load our
      web pages, but we may dynamically include them later after giving the user a chance to opt-in. If you believe
      a third-party resource is automatically loading, please let us know so we can address it.</p>

    <h3>Disclosure Of Your Information</h3>

    <p>While we endeavour to provide the highest level of protection for your information, we may disclose
      personally identifiable information about you to third parties in limited circumstances, including:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>with your consent</li>
      <li>when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or
        other judicial or administrative order
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you
      with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you
      an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given
      us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the
      disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.</p>

    <p>In addition, we will independently object to requests for access to information about users of our site that
      we believe to be improper.</p>

    <h3>Updating Or Removing Your Information</h3>

    <p>You may choose to correct, update, or delete the membership information you have submitted to us by sending an
      email requesting changes to membership@multibit.org. Furthermore, if we inadvertently collect more personal
      information than intended, we endeavour to delete the extraneous information. However, please understand that
      deleted information may continue to persist on encrypted backup media.</p>

    <h3>Changes To Our Policies</h3>

    <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. However, any revised privacy policy will be consistent with
      our approach to respecting your privacy online. If we make any substantive changes to our policies, we will
      send you an email and place a prominent notice in the main pages of the site. Previous versions of the policy will
      remain publicly available.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>

    <p>We employ industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information
      under our control. We use HTTPS by default.</p>

    <p>Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected by us in a secure operating environment,
      we cannot guarantee complete security. Information collected by us will be maintained for a length of time
      appropriate to our needs.</p>

    <h3>Update History</h3>
