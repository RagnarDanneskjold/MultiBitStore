          <h3>Bitcoin: A currency I can believe in</h3>

          <p>Back in early 2011 I read an article about Bitcoin. It immediately grabbed me as something special. Ravenously, I devoured all the
          information I could find about how it all worked. I read the <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="">Satoshi paper</a> and was both reassured by its straightforward approach to the 
          problems of double-spend and impressed by the correct use of cryptography. I spent a lot of time following posts and discussion on the forums gathering more information about what could be done with it. I learned more about economics and international banking in that time than in all the years previously - a real eye opener.</p>

          <p>Over time I realised that what was missing was a merchant platform that would enable anyone, anywhere to start up their own
          business and for it to seamlessly link into other Bitcoin businesses, forming supply chains that spanned the globe. At the same time
          I discovered a whole raft of new and interesting web development technologies that I wanted to learn. Thus by writing a serious application dedicated to Bitcoin I could apply these technologies in a real world setting - a real win/win situation.</p>
          
          <p>You can read more about this process <a href="http://gary-rowe.com/agilestack/2012/06/06/multibit-merchant-genesis/" target="_blank">in my blog</a>.

          <h3>Do I have to buy anything?</h3>

          <p>No. MultiBit Merchant is free for you to take away and use. Its purpose is to help others to grow the Bitcoin economy so that the world
          may benefit from more efficient trade.</p>
          
          <p>However, you should know that I offer a managed service so that merchants can focus on running their business without the hassle of running their own IT infrastructure. By offering a fixed subscription model based on traffic, and no transaction fees, I believe that most merchants will find it easier to do business with bitcoins through MultiBit Merchant than by any other means.</p>

          <h3>What does your company stand for?</h3>

          <p>We want to bring back privacy to the online world. We want to be able to buy something and not wonder if there is
          an enormous database about all our purchases being sold to the highest bidder. If we want to buy something anonymously,
          we want to be sure that the merchant we're dealing with respects that. MultiBit Merchant makes that happen.</p>

          <p>We want to enable people to think for themselves. It is fine to work for a company that respects you and pays you
          accordingly, it is another to be forced to work at something that makes you miserable. There are great opportunities out
          there, and sometimes we all need a lift to get us started. MultiBit Merchant can help <strong>you</strong> get started, and then keep
          you going by connecting you with other people who can help.</p>
