      <h2>Built on MultiBit Merchant</h2>

      <p>MultiBit Merchant is trading, reinvented. It is designed to minimise the amount of time you have to spend
        looking after it - most of it is fully automatic. It is intended to free you from a traditional working life and
        introduce you to a different approach.</p>

          <h3>Trading, reinvented</h3>

          <p>At MultiBit, our mission is making international trade accessible and easy for anyone, anywhere.
            And while anyone can download our software and use it for free, not everyone can make purchases
            on the web because of limits on traditional payment networks.

          <p>With MultiBit Merchant all that changes: you can now sell your goods and services to anyone, anywhere
            using Bitcoin.</p>

          <p>You might be interested to learn that PayPal blocks sales from over 60 countries, and many credit
            card companies have similar restrictions. Some are blocked for political reasons, some because of
            higher fraud rates, and some for other financial reasons. Whatever the reason, we don’t think an
            individual from one of these countries should have diminished access to purchases because of payment
            issues they can’t control. Our goal is to enable honest and legal trade between people, not block them.</p>

          <p><a href="http://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin</a> is a digital currency that enables instant payments over the
            internet. Unlike credit cards
            and PayPal, Bitcoin has no central authority and no way to lock entire countries out of the network.
            Merchants who accept Bitcoin payments can do business with anyone.</p>

          <h3>Privacy</h3>

          <p>We want to bring back privacy to the online world. We want to be able to buy something and not wonder if
            there is
            an enormous database about all our purchases being sold to the highest bidder. If we want to buy something
            anonymously,
            we want to be sure that the merchant we're dealing with respects that. MultiBit Merchant makes that
            happen.</p>

        <div class="span9">
          <h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>

          <p>We want to enable people to think for themselves. It is fine to work for a company that respects you and
            pays you
            accordingly, it is another to be forced to work at something that makes you miserable. There are great
            opportunities out
            there, and sometimes we all need a lift to get us started. MultiBit Merchant can help <strong>you</strong>
            get started, and then keep
            you going by connecting you with other people who can help.</p>

          <h3>Do I have to pay for MultiBit Merchant?</h3>

          <p>No. MultiBit Merchant is free for you to take away and use. Its purpose is to help others to grow the
            Bitcoin economy so that the world
            may benefit from more efficient trade.</p>

          <h3>Do I have to pay for you to host my site?</h3>

          <p>Yes, but only a subscription - we don't take transaction fees.</p>

          <p>We offer a managed service so that merchants like you can focus on running their business without the
            hassle of
            running their own IT infrastructure. By offering a
            fixed subscription model based on traffic, and no transaction fees, we believe that most merchants will find
            it easier to do business with bitcoins through MultiBit Merchant than by any other means.</p>

          <h3>Developer's comments</h3>

          <h4>Gary Rowe - Lead Developer</h4>

          <p>Back in early 2011 I read an article about Bitcoin. It immediately grabbed me as something special.
            Ravenously, I devoured all the
            information I could find about how it all worked. I read the <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"
                                                                            target="">Satoshi paper</a> and was both
            reassured by its straightforward approach to the
            problems of double-spend and impressed by the correct use of cryptography. I spent a lot of time following
            posts and discussion on the forums gathering more information about what could be done with it. I learned
            more about economics and international banking in that time than in all the years previously - a real eye
            opener.</p>

          <p>Over time I realised that what was missing in the Bitcoin ecosystem was a merchant platform that would enable anyone, anywhere to
            start up their own
            business and for it to seamlessly link into other Bitcoin businesses, forming supply chains that spanned the
            globe. At the same time
            I discovered a whole raft of new and interesting web development technologies that I wanted to learn. Thus
            by writing a serious application dedicated to Bitcoin I could apply these technologies in a real world
            setting - a real win/win situation.</p>
